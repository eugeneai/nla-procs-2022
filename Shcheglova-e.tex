A range of questions related to the impulse response matrix \cite{reff1} for a system of linear differential-algebraic equations (DAE) \cite{reff2} is considered. For systems with infinitely differentiable coefficients, it is shown that this matrix is represented as a sum of the impulse response matrices of the differential and algebraic subsystems.  The form of  non-degenerate change of variables has been found, which does not affect the view of impulse response matrix.  Realizations of this matrix are proposed to construct  in the class of index 1 DAE, which are separated into dfferential and algebraic parts. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the realisability  of an impulse response matrix in the class of algebraic systems are obtained.
